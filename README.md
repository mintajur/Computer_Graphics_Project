# Computer_Graphics_Project
This repository will have a project named "Karnaphuli Tunnel-Graphic View" which was developed by me using the C++ programming language. My project efficiently shows  a Graphical View of the Karnaphuli Tunnel. There are vehicular transitions like cars, trucks, ships etc. There  is a day and night effect and rainy effect as well.
